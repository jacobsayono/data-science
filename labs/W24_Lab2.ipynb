A box plot, a histogram, a scatter plot, or something else? That will depend on the purpose of the plot (is it for performing an inspection on your data (EDA, or for showing your results/conclusions to people) and the number variables that you want to plot.\n","\n","You have a lot of tools for plotting in Python. The basic one, of course, is `matplotlib` and there are other libraries that are built on top of it, such as `seaborn`, `bokeh`, or `altair`.\n","\n","In this class we will continue using `matplotlib` and also look into [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org). Those two libraries are the ones you should be using for homework.\n","\n","### Introduction to `seaborn`\n","\n","`Seaborn` is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. The library provides a database of useful datasets for educational purposes that can be loaded by typing:\n","\n","```python\n","seaborn.load_dataset(name, cache=True, data_home=None, **kws)\n","```\n","\n","For information on what these datasets are : https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data\n","\n","#### The plotting functions in `seaborn` can be decided in two categories\n","\n","- **'axes-level'** functions, such as `regplot`, `boxplot`, `kdeplot`, `scatterplot`, `distplot` which can connect with the `matplotlib` Axes object and its parameters. You can use that object as you would in `matplotlib`:\n","```python\n","f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2)\n","sns.regplot(x, y, ax=ax1)\n","sns.kdeplot(x, ax=ax2)\n","ax1 = sns.distplot(x, kde=False, bins=20)\n","```\n","\n","- **'figure-level'** functions, such as `lmplot`, `factorplot`, `jointplot`, `relplot`. In this case, `seaborn` organizes the resulting plot which may include several Axes in a meaningful way. That means that the functions need to have total control over the figure, so it isn't possible to plot, say, an `lmplot` onto one that already exists. Calling the function always initializes a figure and sets it up for the specific plot it's drawing. These functions return an object of the type `FacetGrid` with its own methods for operating on the resulting plot.\n","\n","To set the parameters for figure-level functions:\n","\n","```python\n","sns.set_context(\"notebook\", font_scale=1, rc={\"lines.linewidth\": 2.5})\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mt8qxpjQbYLy"},"source":["### The Titanic dataset\n","\n","The `titanic.csv` file contains data for 887 passengers on the Titanic.
